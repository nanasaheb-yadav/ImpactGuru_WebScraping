Dear Supporters,

We are reaching out for your help and request with folded hands for immediate attention. Settem Sujatha Prasad, 51 years old is a known hypertensive, non-smoker, and non-alcoholic. 
She has a husband, and two children 24 years and 26 years old. 

A humble appeal from Sujatha's Daughter, 24 years old Priyanka Settem, to all of you to save her mother Sujatha.

She was initially infected with coronavirus and Hospitalized in Tanvir Hospital, a small hospital near her place, on 13th April after her post-vaccination symptoms did not improve. Upon admission, she tested negative for the virus on a swab test but HRCT confirmed the Covid-19 diagnosis. Slowly her condition started to deteriorate with her Oxygen Saturations dipping to as low as 60s. Soon she was moved to the ICU and was being managed with heavy Oxygen support, and Steroids along with the usual COVID Care. 

When her Sats failed to improve and the infection in the lungs kept progressing she was moved to Apollo hospitals, Jubilee hills, Hyderabad, for better facility and Care. 

During her stay in the ICU at Apollo, her family had to bear expenses of Remdesivir, which at that time was only available in the black market and procurement was very difficult, Oxygen cylinders and other medications. 

After staying for over a month at the ICU in Apollo, she was moved to the regular Non COVID ICU for continued monitoring, during which she was found to be infected with the Black Fungus or Mucormycosis. 
The doctors had to immediately perform endoscopic sinus surgery to clear the infection followed by Amphotericin B treatment.
The hunt for the medicine was exhausting with the medicine being out of stock for days. 
After spending lakhs in just procurement of the said medicine, her family was able to see her through the antifungal treatment. 

Through this entire process, the family has been using up all their life savings to pay for the medicines, facilities, and hospital bills. 
As of today, the family has had to pay nearly 30lakhs for all of the expenses. 

On 26th May 2021, Sujatha was discharged from the hospital and sent home after she was doing better at the hospital. 

At home, she was still on oxygen support with the help of the oxygen concentrator. 
On the 31st morning, she started profusely bleeding from her nose and mouth. The ambulance was summoned to take her to the hospital. In the ambulance, she started vomiting blood. She was rushed back to Apollo hospitals. The doctors suspect the Black fungus to have eroded the arteries causing heavy bleeding. 

Embolization of the arteries was performed immediately after which her bleeding was brought under control. As of today, my mother is now back in the ICU, this time hooked to the Ventilator. 

The hospital and treatment bills are skyrocketing and the family is unable to manage the finances. 

The treatment so far has cost about 30 lakhs in rupees. The recent embolization surgery along with necessary medications has additionally costed 2-2.5lakhs. She is now currently in the hospital ICU, and the bill will continue to increase. The family has now exhausted all their financial resources and seeks any kind of monetary support that they can get. 

Even the smallest contribution will make a big difference. Kindly please help.

Hi, my name is Nikunj and I am raising funds for my younger brother Ujjwal who is suffering from blood cancer.

My brother has been fighting for his life since he was 21 years old. He doesn't have any medical insurance so we have to do all the treatment in cash only. He diagnosed with Blood Cancer first time in 2017 treated in Artemis Hospital by Dr. Raman Kain.

But due to Bad luck, I say the disease was Relapsed again in May 2019 followed by Chemotherapy Sessions, and then we have to immediately undergo a bone marrow transplant at the Asian Institute of medical science by Dr. Prashant Mehta, and & total cost of treatment was around 18 lakhs.

Bt after completing the transplant, unfortunately, the disease relapsed again a second time in form of tumor masses in the chest, abdomen, and spines.

“Currently he has undergone chemo injections and a tablet called Venetoclax which is very costly (Approx 1 lakh for 1 month) as it’s Imported Medicine but its require urgently to control the disease for a time being to be able to start the further suggested treatment although it is very difficult to purchase this medicine as all our funds already debited”

Now doctor told me that my brother requires urgent treatment with inj. Nelarabine followed by a second Allogenic bone marrow transplant and the cost for the above treatment will be 50 lac INR approx.

""My brother still fighting however, cancer seems to take more and more control of his body "".
Having faced that situation twice, I pray to God none of the parents ever have the ill fortune to witness their own child suffering from cancer from time and again ..

My family's happiness lies in ujjwal. Him being the youngest member of my family of four, all of us are accustomed to his joyous and playful .when he becomes extremely sick the first time he was scared and sad. Yet he tried to cheer all of us as much as he could.

The treatment is costing us 50lakh and we need funds to continue the treatment. we are unable to pay the required amount because we cannot afford such a huge amount.

My father treatment is going on for Covid 19 and it's post effect since 26 April 2021.

Today, he is in critical condition with 80% infection in left lung and 40% right lung. His heart is also working with only 35% capacity and BP continuously being very low. 

At Yatharth Hospital, doctors treatment and sisters care help him to cope up mentally and physically.

He showed some signs of improvement initially but now his condition is critical and doctors and hospital staff is doing their best to save him. 

Initially, at home, I tried to give best possible treatment from private nurse, oxygen concentrator to costliest medicines and injections. 

His covid situation improved but his lungs condition deteriorated. 

We admitted him in Max Hospital, Patparganj on 24 May but next 10 days turnout to be a nightmare for my father's health and left huge financial hole in pocket. 

When we saw him after 10Days, he was just a skeleton without flesh. By God's grace we shifted him to Yatharth Hospital, Noida Extension on 4 June 2021.

During this period his lungs got severely affected with 20/25 latest CT score and increased diffuse mediastinal emphysema. 

Last two months were very challenging mentally, physically and financially for me and my family specially for my mother. 

This might be his last chance to get some more time to play with his grand daughter and create wonderful memories for her. 

Please help me to give my father one last chance to have few more wonderful moments of life and nurturing my daughter with his love, wisdom and compassion.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

My name is Meera Ahuja and I am raising funds for my husband, Rocchak Ahuja who is suffering from Covid 19 and Pneumonia. He is on ventilator support for the past 44 days. He has been diagnosed with “Cavitatory Lung Abscess “. To address this, he must undergo a major surgery as soon as possible. He is currently in the ICU undergoing treatment at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai.

So far, we have managed to pay Rs 22 lakhs till date from our end. Furthermore, Rs 35-40 lakhs are the amount required for continuing the treatment and we are in a shortage of funds to continue the treatment. We have exhausted all our savings and insurances for his treatment so far. He is the sole bread winner in our family, and we have an 8-year-old son. We are unable to pay the required amount because we cannot afford or arrange such a huge amount required for the surgery on such short notice.

The global lockdown has caused several people to lose their source of livelihood, and battle with emotional, physical, and mental health issues. These concerns double up for the people who are underprivileged and have no access to proper food, healthcare, and education.

Growing up in Malvani, I saw the hardships of people who live in the slums. 

After Salma Memon Founder of Umeed Foundation lost my father the hardships I underwent, I saw that there are many who are undergoing the same and there is hardly any growth in the literacy rate of Malvani. That’s when I decided to take the first step towards bringing the change since 2014-12015

We at UMEED are trying hard to support Hunger and at the same time, we also understand education is the key that we can gift to these children.

We request you to contribute and help us to feed the meal and also help these children to continue their education. Because of the financial crisis, these daily wagers are unable to earn amount and are suffering.

The cost for food for a day for a child is Rs. 100 and the cost for a child's education are Rs.10,000 to Rs.15000.It differs from school to school.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

India is going through an unprecedented catastrophe of all times and while most of us are grappling with the situation, we cannot even fathom the struggle of people in Rural india who neither have access to medical facilities nor information or help via social media. In these tough times, Wagons Skill Foundation has pledged to fight this battle by providing Oxygen concentrators to remote villages of India. These concentrators will be donated to Village Sarpanch, Primary Healthcare Centres, Village Associations etc. which will act as Oxygen points for villagers in need. Additionally, training will be provided for using these oxygen concentrators safely and effectively. Awareness building activities will be conducted on topics like importance of safe distancing, personal hygiene, following covid protocols, early detection of covid symptoms, timely isolation and importance of getting vaccinated. Our Mission is to make Oxygen accessible to the marginalised and vulnerable communities in remote parts of india through the BREATHE FOR RURAL campaign. Our ideas are big, but resources are limited. So we are reaching out to all of you for helping us generate enough funds to make this mission possible and support our neglected rural population during this time of crisis. Mahatma Gandhi once said - “The Soul of India Lives in its Villages”. 
Lets come together to Save our Villages and Save India!

Nepal Needs Our Help, Now More Than Ever
NPR 10,850,000 / USD $94,347.83 can help in provision of 5,000 COVID-19 relief kits to marginalized population infected with COVID-19 in remote villages of Nepal 
NPR 43,980,000/ USD $382,434.78 can help  in the provision of 1200 COVID-19 health equipment kits to isolation centres and hospitals
Nepal is currently grappling with the infectious and deadlier second wave of COVID-19. The rapid peak in infection rate has brought the health infrastructure to its knees. With the lack of enough safety kits, life- saving medicines and medical care access, the situation of the marginalised and poor people of Nepal has worsened.
GOAL 1: Supporting marginalised infected populations with COVID-19 relief kits
People from Tharu community of Nepal, the historically disadvantaged group of bonded labourers and other community members, are facing grave consequences due to lack of access to preventive measures, adequate medical care and income instability.
As most people from the Tharu community and others in Nepal belong to the poorer sections of society and live in remote villages with limited medical resources, accessing a basic medicines and medical facilities has become even more difficult in these time of surged demand.
Therefore we are making efforts to provide medical care access to such people through visits by a team of doctors and nurses to villages and communities and distribute safety and relief kits to the needy.
Our aim is to fundraise
NPR 10,850,000 / USD $94,347.83
in provision of 5,000 COVID-19 relief kits to the infected patients. Each relief kit will contain lifesaving equipment such as paracetamol tablets, masks, ORS, multi-vitamin tablets, vaporiser, soaps and sanitary pads; that can help vulnerable families protect themselves and their loved ones from succumbing to this grave infection.
You can support by contributing any amount convenient. Cost per kit NPR 2,170/USD $18.87.
GOAL 2: Supporting district hospitals and isolation centres with essential health and sanitisation equipment and materials.
Nepal’s health infrastructure is facing severe shortage of essential materials, disinfection and life-saving equipment even in the government run hospitals and dispensaries, which has led to delayed treatment and untimely death of patients in many cases. 
Our aim is to fundraise
NPR 43,980,000/ USD $382,434.78
that can help distribute 1200 COVID-19 kits to local hospitals and isolation centres. These kits will include pulse oximeters, PPE sets, infrared thermometers, surgical gloves, and surgical masks, chlorine solutions, pumping spray for disinfection, vaporisers, and nebulisers. 
You can support by contributing any amount convenient. Cost per kit NPR 35,650/USD $318.70
We urge you to contribute to support those in dire need of help. Any amount, however large or small, is truly appreciated…

As the nation continues to fight the battle against coronavirus, people need your support now more than ever before. After hitting the urban areas, the Covid-19 wave has now moved into rural India.

“A phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus, but it is not clear on what time scale this phase 3 will occur.

Hopefully, incrementally, we should prepare for new waves. Previous infections and vaccines will cause adaptive pressure on the virus for new kinds of changes which try to escape, and, therefore, we should be prepared, scientifically, to take care of that,” said K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor to the Government of India.

Another Expert Quoted ""The Spanish Flu hit the world in three waves; it affected 2/3rd of the world’s population before it disappeared. But does this mean coronavirus will disappear after the third wave? No, there is no guarantee.

We may see a few more and distinct waves in the coming years. After that, the virus will run out of evolutionary options and settle down as a more benign, endemic pathogen,""

Even your smallest contribution can help save a life! Hospital & Covid Care Centre Support

The existing medical infrastructure in the country is under a lot of pressure. We must act immediately to take action on the third and more severe wave of Covid-19. We need your help to make our efforts successful!

You can help us in meeting the evolving need for oxygen-related supplies including PSA Oxygen Generation plants and equipment including testing machines, ECG, Bi Pap machine, and more at the hospitals and at the special covid care centers.

As the Third Wave has hit a few parts of the world already (Singapore & Brazil) and is expected to hit India in the next 3-4 months, we are gearing ourselves to be able to cater to upcoming challenges.
 The huge number of oxygen concentrators and equipment being used in metropolitans like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, can be moved to rural India for help now, as the peak is shifted to tier 2 and 3 cities.
 Ujala Cygnus Hospitals are placed majorly out in tier-2 and tier-3 regions and would be shuffling resources to undertake maximum utilization and saving lives.

The government of India is providing resources received through multiple countries in areas of need but till now upkeep and utilization of these resources are constricted due to political reasons. We are not influenced under such criteria and are committed to saving lives with dignity, affordability, and quality for all.

In recent times, Hospitals were scrambling to maintain oxygen supply, patients were being turned away due to lack of critical support, and relatives crying for support - you would have come across such stories of horror.

In response to this crisis, we have launched this initiative to get support in setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals and save lives.

In partnership with various NGOs, we aim to build oxygen plants in our premises for self-sustainable and uninterrupted supply to patients.

These plants will not only help during the current Covid crisis but also prepare for any future waves of unprecedented epidemics for years to come.

Currently, we are hoping to install 10 oxygen plants at our various hospitals in North India – Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.

The requirements of rural and tier-2 and 3 regions are undermined and we have taken this initiative to come forward and gear ourselves to help all.

We are already in the process to set up 2 oxygen plants at our hospitals located in Delhi and Karnal. And now we are aiming to set up more oxygen plants.

The second wave of COVID-19 has escalated the severity of the pandemic tremendously, especially in India. Everyone reading this has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, the ones belonging to the lower socioeconomic strata of society are the ones who have faced the worst brunt. Thousands of children have lost either the only or both of their parents and many of these children have been tragically abandoned with no one to turn to. A humanitarian soul of our society, Akancha Srivastava, has set up a reporting mechanism and is redirecting these children to a safe space. NOTE- they aren’t all toddlers.


Akancha Srivastava is the founder & director of 'Akancha Against Harassment'- India’s largest social impact initiative for cyber safety, a vertical of Akancha Srivastava Foundation.

We've got tremendous support from various media houses across the globe including the likes Bloomberg Businessweek, FRANCE 24 English, Times of India, Deccan Herald, BOOMLIVE, Hindustan Times, SBS News, AAJ TAK, KSU, and many more for our work.

In early May 2021, her social media accounts and website chatbot were flooded with appeals to help out children who have been left to fend for themselves during the pandemic.

The shockwave of the virus has uprooted many families and has added fuel to the fire where the number of orphans was already high and the child-rights violation & trafficking was a critical issue. While this problem had prevailed even before the pandemic, now the kids are having to face it all by themselves, and often no one left to turn to for help. 

These children are in a state of shock and at the risk of being in physically dangerous, vulnerable situations in these chaotic times. Many of these orphans are at risk of being put up for illegal adoption. Srivastava mentions “Our authorities are overburdened, people are hassled. It's extremely easy in these circumstances to misassign a child to some trafficking racket or an adoption racket.” Ever since Akancha Srivastava Foundation set up a WhatsApp helpline to help out these children, they have been receiving more 100s of calls & messages every single day These numbers reflect the dire situation for the future of our country out there.

We at Shankar Prasad Ashram live in close communion with the village, its residents, and the environment. Through our various community projects like our Student’s Welfare Program, Women’s Empowerment Initiative, and our very close to heart Muddu Play School for village children we strive to uplift the community and give back in whatever little way we can.
At present, our village Bankikodla has unfortunately been affected by a horrible wave of COVID-19, with our district Uttara Kannada having a positivity rate of 42% one of the highest positive rates.
Most of the locals here are daily wagers and due to the lockdown rules are unable to seek employment. Having no income and already reeling in poverty, they are in dire need of basic supplies for survival.
We have identified the most-in-need families and initiated a process to procure everyday grocery items like rice, sugar, tea, lentils, cooking oil, vegetables, soaps, masks and so on. These items will then be made into kits and distributed to poor families in the village especially the destitute, handicapped, isolated elderly persons, lone widows and those who do not possess a ration card and the presently unemployed living below poverty line.
We ask that you make a humble contribution to our initiative and lend a hand at this crucial time to the people of Bankikodla. Your contributions can go a long way in helping these individuals and families gain access to food supplies and basic items so that they can get through these troubled times. 
Thanking you for your constant support!

HealingTrain Foundation is a non-profit organization run by a group of doctors and healthcare workers committed to provide better healthcare facilities, hygiene education, health education programs, providing ration kits and food distribution during the Covid-19 crisis. We have reached 25000 people for the past few months and provided the needy, homeless and destitute with the essentials, ration kits and distributed food for the underprivileged, provided oxygen cylinders to the people in dire need. It is our endeavor to reach out to every person at the grass root level of the society. 

Over the last few weeks, thousands of Indians have lost the battle against Covid-19 due to shortages of oxygen, medicines and hospital facilities. Many of those who managed to survive did so with the help of healthcare resources they procured by pleading and begging friends and strangers on social media.

About the Fundraiser

Severe cyclonic storm, Yaas caused massive damage in the coastal regions of West Bengal and Odisha on 25-26 May, 2021. The inhabitants of Sundarbans suffered major losses last year due to the impact of Amphan, a super cyclonic storm. Rebuilding was still under process when another severe cyclone hit this year and thousands of people lost their homes, and their belongings. Sending disaster relief to Sundarbans is challenging because of its remote location and poor connectivity to the nearest city. Baikunthapur Tarun Sangha (BTS), a local NGO has played a key role in distributing relief after every major calamity in the region since 1978. BTS is committed to improving the rural lives, empowering the underprivileged, and protecting the environment of Sundarbans.

Our goal is to provide shelter, clothing, food, drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene essentials to 1000+ households

We have begun a fundraiser and our target is INR 62,00,000

A team of 50 BTS volunteers are working on the ground to help the distressed people. But without your donation and support, they cannot succeed. Join us in saving the lives of thousands with your generosity. You can review the budget details here.

My name is Dr. Arjun Sachidanand and I am raising funds for an innovative plan to assist the vulnerable Geriatric population, people with one or more co-morbid conditions and the underprivileged rural population during these difficult times of the Covid-19 Pandemic in the form of “Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV” through Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Educational Trust in association with SAS Poorna Arogya Health Care Program and Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Hospitals.

We have come up with an idea for a vehicle - “Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV”, which essentially is a Lab on Wheels that could go door-to-door and conduct various laboratory tests pertaining to patients' existing conditions as well as provide a means of getting them in touch via Telemedicine with a doctor who could give them sound medical advice, thereby preventing them from having to visit hospitals and coming in contact with potential sources of infection.
This method also serves a dual purpose. This will greatly lessen the burden on hospitals and labs. It will also be used to collect data regarding age, sex, travel history, existing symptoms and pre-existing co-morbid conditions. So, there is a possibility of detecting previously undiagnosed diseases as well. 
4 SAVs will be launched initially in 3 districts of Karnataka, namely Mysore, Kodagu & Chamarajanagar, where Dr. M. D. Sachidananda Murthy Memorial Hospitals are situated.

SAV
They will each be equipped with a Haematology Analyzer, Biochemical Analyzer, ECG Machine, Sphygmomanometer and Pulse Oximeter. They will consist of a sink, soap dispenser, cupboards, medicine cabinets, waste bins, chairs along with having power and water supply. One of the main components of these vehicles is a “Tele-Communication Kiosk”, which consists of a computer that will form a doctor-patient interface and a printer which will be used to deliver reports of laboratory tests to the patients. Lab reports will also be delivered to patients’ registered mobile numbers in view of maintaining confidentiality and conserve paper. 

Lab Investigations that will be performed by SAV:
These are an array of investigations that can be done at the SAV at subsidized costs. Reports of lab investigations shall be given to the patient for future use.
1. Complete Blood Count
2. Blood Sugar Analysis - FBS/PPBS/RBS/HbA1c
3. Renal Function Tests - Blood Urea/Serum Creatinine/Serum Uric Acid
4. Liver Function Tests
5. Lipid Profile
6. Thyroid Function Tests
7. Urine dipstick tests
8. ECG
9. Blood Grouping
10. Serum Calcium
11. Serum Ferritin
12. D-Dimer
13. LDH
14. Various Card Tests

Impact of SAV on the socio-economic problems of rural sector:
The socio-economic burden of COVID-19 is more recognized in the rural sector. For every visit an individual has to make to the hospital he/she has to bear the travel expenses, lab test costs and also the consultation fees of the doctor. SAV will definitely make a significant difference in this regard as the diagnosis will be at the door step and consultation will be done online free of cost. Also, through SAV the laboratory investigations are done at a subsidized cost which would otherwise cost the patient a considerable sum. This will help the patients monetarily in a substantial way.

Sustainability:
We intend to make SAV a self - sustainable model. The remuneration collected from the laboratory investigations (which are subsidized) will be utilized to buy lab reagents and other consumables. It will also provide for the salaries of support staff of SAV. 

Scalability:
SAV will begin as a pilot project with 4 units covering 3 districts of Mysore, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu. It will scale to cover the 114 network hospitals registered under SAS Poorna Arogya Program situated in Karnataka and the North-Eastern states of Assam, Mizoram and Meghalaya in a phased manner requiring a duplication of 114 more such Lab in a Van (Sudhanand Arogya Vahini - SAV) units.

We, Maattrathai Nokki Arakkatalai ( MaNo Charitable Trust) Registered as a Charitable trust bearing registration number 104/2017 in Tamilnadu, India. We were witnessing losing lives in front of our eyes for the past 12 months. When we inquired about the story of death, mostly boils down to three main reasons

1.Affordability & availability of ambulance, yes many private ambulances exploit the situation and charge abnormally. Government Ambulance availability is a big challenge and it is mostly NOT available for underprivileged and voiceless people
2.Inability or lack of knowledge to find the availability in hospital through the internet or other means. When the usual attempt to nearby Hospital fails, most of the low-income group and underprivileged people really don't know the next step
3.Making decisions on when to move to the Hospital from home, on which date of symptoms and on what symptoms are completely a dark area, most of the cases start after losing consciousness and thus they lose Golden hour too.

We are attempting to place an Ambulance with oxygen support 24X7. The trust number will inquire about the situation of the patient in call, if necessary, bring in Doctors on a video conference to validate the criticality of the situation, then identify the bed availability through the Government website, Hospital numbers, and doctors who are members and volunteers in our trust. Pick up the patient at right time and admit to the right facility leaving the rest to the Hospital and experts to save.

We tried helping families who lost the breadwinners and serious patients to get them back, we thought those are firefighting and short-lived solutions, but lifting a patient at right time and admitting in the right facility can be the more productive and meaningful solution and hence stated this initiative. Our trust members and volunteers contributed to the initiative and we are short of Rs.300000 to accomplish our goal.

This reaching out to helping hands, so that we can save hundreds of lives with this solution in the coming days. We have enclosed our appeal and samples of our past activities reported in the reputed press publications as an introduction to our trust. Please support our initiative and help us reach the last mile of our goal.

Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage is an organisation working to improve the lives of rural people in West Bengal since 2013. Last year they organised an extensive COVID relief program and provided support for more than 2lakh underprivileged people.

This year with more than 4 lakh new cases, India's total caseload crosses 17 million. India has set a new global record for a rise in daily coronavirus cases, while deaths from COVID-19 also jumped to an all-time high.

West Bengal logged the highest single day spike of 20846 new cases last week and it has not even hit its peak yet. Kolkata is witnessing a huge shortage of resources in treating corona virus cases. In these circumstances, the demand for Oxygen is increasing everyday and supply is very limited.

KSCH had started an initiative to help provide Oxygen to the those who need it and are unable to afford it. They started with a goal of procuring 100 oxygen cylinders and so far with the support of donors, have been able to procure 47 cylinders.

Each one of these cylinders costs anywhere from Rs.18000 - Rs.30000. There is additional cost for support equipment like flow meters, Oxygen masks, refillable oxygen cylinders, oxygen canisters etc. In the current situation, the prices for all these have increased because of a high demand.
Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage has a proven track record of supporting rural Bengal and has a solid plan of action for COVID relief in the city and districts. Funds raised with this campaign will be used to procure 47-liter O2 cylinders and supporting equipment.

KSCH has already created dedicated helplines (24-hr) to receive requests for O2, 24 volunteers have been allocated to receive orders and deliver cylinders. KSCH was able to procure 47 cylinders with the generosity of donors like you and has saved 1,114 lives so far. The goal is to procure a total of 100 cylinders to be able to save more lives.

I am Vivek Gadicherla, a student of Grade 10 in Bangalore. I found out about KSCH through my Mom while she was speaking to the founder about their initiative to help people during this crisis. I wanted to do something to help them procure these Oxygen cylinders so, I decided to started this crowdfunding campaign to raise Rs.200000 towards their objective.

A team of 100+ volunteers and employees are working hard to help KSCH meet their objective of saving lives. But they can’t do it without your help. Join me in helping these under privileged people breathe easy with your generosity.

Please Donate and Share to help me reach my goal quickly.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

As the nation is dealing with a deadly pandemic, we are also witnessing the humanitarian nature of our society with everyone lending a helping hand to one another in any way possible. The shortage of oxygen/ventilator/hospital beds has put a huge number of lives at risk especially for the underserved individuals of our society who are unable to afford it at exorbitant rates.

Ever since the second wave’s shock wave hit the country, our lives have been turned upside down. Everyone has been affected in some or another way. However, the worst brunt has been faced by the ones who belong to a low socioeconomic background. Without the necessary finances available to afford healthcare, many of them are sitting outside hospitals trying to save their families. 

Our NGO, Serving Smile NGO, is based out of Delhi and we are helping people by providing oxygen concentrator at NO COST. With higher prices of oxygen concentrator, a lot of families are not able to afford it and that's risking the lives of people.
 To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise 500000 to procure more oxygen concentrator. We have already helped 2 families and we want to help more families.

 Join us in helping millions with your generosity.

As the nation is dealing with the second wave of COVID 19, the number of deaths and cases are spiraling out of control every day. This has created a massive shortage of healthcare resources and has left the country gasping for breath. With the end nowhere on the horizon, help from the community has provided assistance to many during these trying times. 41 Clubs of India are another such group that has taken an initiative to provide Bipap machines to many hospitals in various towns of the country.

Ballari Medical college Batch 81 ( VIMS ) led by Radhika Bobba and Vidya Ponnathpur, are helping 41ers clubs of India & Round Table India, a local non-profit, to provide operational support and ongoing funding. Round Table is an international organization in 67 countries, with 5000 members across 124 cities in India. Round Table has a proven track record of large-scale, operationally successful projects in small towns and cities across India.

41 Clubs of India is a charitable organization that has been working with its sister organizations, Round Table India and Round Table Foundation, to provide necessary healthcare facilities during the pandemic. They have helped by distributing masks and providing oxygen to patients so that they can receive timely help. 

During the course of their relief work, they were approached by many hospitals that were in dire need of oxygen to treat their patients. Lack of oxygen is claiming many lives when timely care can save them from an inevitable end with non-ICU care. The need for respiratory care is immediate and urgent.

41 Clubs of India wish to procure at least 56 Bipap machines that can provide oxygen support to non-ICU patients. The BiLevel ST from Medicraft is easily adaptable to the requirements of various patients and extremely essential during these times. Each costs Rs 60,000 and the total cost for getting these machines is unaffordable for a non-profit organization.  

The shortage of funds is proving to be a massive hurdle in getting countless people the necessary help. With the sudden hike in the prices of healthcare commodities, the majority of the population in India is finding it extremely difficult to afford it. We cannot save millions, but you can definitely save one. Please donate whatever you can to give a hand towards countless underprivileged people who have no one left to turn to. Even sharing this story on social media will immensely help the cause. We request you to help out in whatever way possible as we’re all in this together and can get through this, together!","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser.

Our NGO Abhilash Cricket Academy is based out of bhubaneswar and we are committed to impacting and improving lives. To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise 1500000 for the Livelihood Support.

We are a team of many coaches, who are also social workers as their secondary engagement in life.. We are trying to drive a fundraising camp to help financially to all those coaches who are actually in trouble due to loss of income since Covid outbreak. 

Privately employed Coaches are now completely unemployed due to Covid-19 pandemic. Even they cannot do any business as all business halted by the order of the local government’s shutdown. Even experienced coaches have lost their contractual jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic and are now left with no options other than taking menial jobs to make their ends meet.

Coaches in Odisha are finding it hard to fulfill the basic needs of their families after losing job due to Covid-19 pandemic. The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic in March last year and the second wave this year has forced many experienced and talented coaches in Odisha to take up menial jobs to make their ends meet. Before the pandemic hit India, they were training students on a contractual basis, and players use to give them monthly fees upon which they use to maintain their livelihood. 

Vision –
We have a target to achieve proper livelihood for those coaches who are seriously not in job because of Covid.

Mission –
•  To provide livelihood to the Coaches
•  To accelerate self-motivation and trust over own self, for coaches who are in trouble.
•  Abhilash Cricket Academy will stand aside with the coaches other field staffs to ensure that we live our life with pride. 

How the Trust will utilize the funds raised –
Provide monthly grocery to all affected Coaches. Take care of other basic requirements of a day to day life.


A team of 10 - 50 are working hard to help us meet our objective of transforming lives. But we can’t do that without you. Join us in helping millions with your generosity.

The second wave of the pandemic has set out a shockwave throughout the country and has upturned the lives of countless people. Everyone has been affected by the pandemic in some way and are aware of someone who lost their life. Guru Gobind Singh Foundation is one of the humanitarians who provide a helping hand to everyone in need during these testing times. They need your help to continue their noble work so that we can all get through this difficult time together.

With the prevailing conditions, there has been a massive shortage of essential medical supplies. This shortage has escalated their prices and made it unaffordable, risking many lives in the process.
Guru Gobind Singh Foundation headquartered at Vijaywada
, serving the society for 5 years, now stepped up to provide whatever help they could to anyone in need.  

The entire country is still gasping for oxygen as thousands line up outside government hospitals in a desperate bid to save the lives of their loved ones. The non-profit organization gets multiple calls every day from people who are in dire need of oxygen and can be saved with timely help. Upon receiving any lead, a dedicated team looks after the verification process to assess the request. After a thorough process of verification and confirmation, a member delivers the cylinder wherever needed and ensures that the patient has received the necessary help. 

By pooling in all their resources, they currently have
45 refillable cylinders
in their supply chain. However, the ever-increasing numbers of COVID positive cases and deaths portray the grim reality. Inspite of multiple organizations and individuals stepping up to help with providing free oxygen, the need is prevalent in various corners of the country.

The lockdown also snatched away the jobs of many daily wagers who worked in the informal sector. After more than a year into the lockdown, they have run dry on their savings and have no more avenues left to earn for themselves as well as their families. Guru Gobind Singh Foundation is providing ration kits to them that can help their families survive this critical period. The healthcare staff in government hospitals have been working tirelessly to save as many lives as possible and are stretched out to their maximum capacity.

As India is dealing with a deadly pandemic,

Covid reaching remote and rural India
While the world is going through a very painful situation due to Covid-19, India seems especially helpless with the mounting death tolls adding up every day. With each day passing, the second wave has started to reach the remote areas and rural parts of the country. The healthcare system in these places is extremely vulnerable and are hardly prepared for the hazard.
Our region
Lahaul and Spiti, located in northern Himachal Pradesh, is among the remotest regions in the Himalayan region. Until recently, Lahaul used to remain shut-off from the outside world for almost six months due to heavy snowfall. Even today, it takes two days to reach a decent hospital from Spits during the winter months. If the second wave of COVID-19 reaches here, things can spiral out of control and the death rate can mount aggressively.
Our mission
Young Drukpa Association (YDA) Garsha took proactive steps before the first wave. With your help and support, we aspire to repeat the story and broaden it’s scope before the second wave hits the valley.

Until now, we along with some local supports were able to sustain the campaign financially. However, in the second campaign, we are facing severe fund shortage and appeal all of you to help and support us. With your help, we can protect the people and feed the hungry and needy. Everything has been and shall be distributed free of cost.
Our appeal
Taking these essential preventive measures can stop a catastrophe from happening. Your contribution today can ensure that we don’t stand in a helpless situation tomorrow. We humbly request you to please help us with whatever contribution possible.
Our team is still on ground trying to do everything possible. We will ensure complete transparency by posting all our activities on our pages. You may want to have a look into our activities by visiting our social media pages:

We are grateful for your help!

Your Helping Hand in COVID:
The underserved rural community is facing severe case overload in the COVID second wave.
The rural healthcare is not geared to tackle the crisis due to the shortage in the availability of hospital beds, trained doctors, and access to sustained supplies of oxygen. We are bringing innovative solutions driven by frontline health workers to provide home based remote monitoring solutions for COVID positive cases and effective screening mechanism to reduce the population spread in regions with high case overload. We will ensure to reach out to every community at the last mile who are left behind in this crisis.
   Mission:
Our aim is to distribute 500,000 olfactory screening kits and 2,500 remote monitoring kits in rural and semi-urban regions in Nagaland, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Rajasthan in India.     
 The initiatives your money will support:
 Remote Health Monitoring Support:
Expanding access to COVID-19 positive patients through remote monitoring services. The coordinated medical support, delivered through a hub-and-spoke model, provides patients with continuous care. We have seen patients recover fast and have a lower rate of hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) in critical cases. This has reduced the need for a hospital bed and oxygen support. This tracking mechanism also ensures that family members receive early alerts. The initiative is supported by:
 ·Telemedicine app
·Team of Doctors
·Trained Frontline Health Workers & Paramedics
·Dieticians, and Psychology Consultation
 Olfactory Screening Kits: Loss of Sense of Smell is an early sign of COVID-19. 68 percent of people have reported loss of smell or olfactory impairment in active COVID cases.
 RT-PCR tests are usually done either too early or too late in the infection cycle leading to false-negative results. iKure is introducing scratch & sniff U-Smell-It-Olfactory test that alerts you for an RT-PCR test, isolate, and identify symptomatic patients. The test can be carried out up to 50, 000 tests per day in remote regions by frontline health workers that can effectively track and monitor population spread. It requires less than 5 minutes using select Indian effervescence to detect early loss of smell. A clinically tested product with:
 ·80% Efficacy Rate
·90% Specificity
·FDA Registered & X-Prize Winner
·Clinical Trial at PGIMER, Chandigarh
 Sensing the urgency, we are providing these services free to the underserved communities in the semi-urban and rural areas, which are grossly neglected at this point and we look forward to your support in this endeavour.
 Target:
To raise INR 21,900,000 for Olfactory Screening tests and INR 14,600,000 for Remote Health Monitoring services. Total fund to be raised is INR 36,500,000. These services will be provided free of cost to the underserved population at the last mile.
 About Us: SwitchON
has collaborated with iKure to collectively work towards raising funds, organizing distribution, logistics and identification of the beneficiaries that are in need. We will ensure complete transparency with our donors and pledge that every penny will be utilized to serve the cause of the COVID pandemic.

PROJECT CHHAAV
(An Initiative by IIM Ahmedabad & IIM Bangalore Volunteers)
Measure, Manage, Mitigate

#HealingHands #ProjectCHHAAV

Rural India has nearly half the Covid caseload, but less than 10% of Covid treatment centers in the country. In this context, the role of frontline workers (ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, ANMs) becomes immensely important for triaging and managing the disease.

Project CHHAAV seeks to support India’s frontline community health workers with a basic safety kit, a pulse oximeter, and a pair of thermometers. Support that will allow health workers to mount an effective response to Covid-19 while ensuring their own safety.


*Kit cost has been updated as of 1st June and has been negotiated down to Rs 1450 from Rs 1800.
*Kit cost does not include the transportation, assembly, and NGO supervision costs.
*Basic Safety Kit to be provided to all frontline workers in a rural areas. In addition to the safety kit, oximeters, and thermometers to be given to frontline workers associated with the Department of Health and Family Welfare (ASHA, ANMs, etc.)

Small acts when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world. We urge you all to join hands with us by sponsoring as many kits as you can. You can make donations as low as INR 250. We also accept internation
donations. All donations made from India and the USA are eligible for tax benefits.

If you believe in the cause, please do share the initiative with your friends, family and colleagues. If you are interested in contributing a larger sum, please reach out to us at
projectchhaav@gmail.com. 

How will the donation help? 
● Increased safety of frontline workers
Frontline workers actively track and follow-up with millions of symptomatic and Covid-positive cases in rural areas daily. Unless their safety is ensured, more than half of India’s population is not safe. Yet, most remain unequipped and fall victim to the disease themselves. A basic safety kit will significantly reduce their risk of contracting Covid.

● Effective management of Covid caseload and timely patient referrals
Since rural areas are resource-starved, oximeters and thermometers can help the frontline workers in identifying high-risk patients early enough, thereby pre-empting the need for hospitalization. The same pulse oximeters can also be used to manage child pneumonia. Therefore,
Project CHHAAV not only aids in managing the current crisis but also hopes to leave a long-term imprint in improving lives in rural India.

How are we implementing this project?

We have partnered with RCRC (rcrc. in), a network of 60+ prominent NGOs for this ambitious project. Wherever possible, along with these NGOs, we are also closely working with government functionaries to make our efforts more impactful.

Who are we?

We are a group of faculty, alumni and students at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore. The core group of faculty members from IIM Ahmedabad involved in this effort include Professors

Hey guys! 

Our names are Arnav Gupta and Ranai Loonkar and we are students of grade 10 at Cathedral and John Connon School. We are raising funds to help in the fight against deadly Black Fungus disease, (Mucormycosis) which is currently impacting Covid-19 patients.

Mucormycosis mainly affects people who are immunocompromised or take medicines that lower the body's ability to fight germs and sickness

Mucormycosis is a serious infection and needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medicine, usually Amphotericin B, Posaconazole, or Isavuconazole. A single vial of Amphotericin B costs between Rs. 5000 - 8000 and has to be taken for 4 - 12 weeks depending upon the severity of the disease.

The disease may cause complete loss of vision or impaired vision which may result in the removal of the eye

There is an acute shortage of these medicines in our state and so we are raising money to help source and purchase these medicines for the underprivileged people who cannot afford the treatment. 

The money will be collected in a non-profit trust called Ahimsa Parmo Dharma Trust which will be diverted to the neediest patients with the help of the most esteemed ENT surgeon Dr. Khattar.

Please support us in the fight against Black Fungus and donate as much as you can, even the smallest amount makes a big difference in saving someone's life. Let's come together and help those in need during these difficult times

In the last few weeks, we have experienced & seen the stories of people struggling for oxygen. There are millions of less privileged people around us who don’t realize when their oxygen is dropping, as they have no means to monitor it. If these people are able to timely monitor their oxygen levels, it will not only save their lives but also aid in controlling the panic in our hospitals.
This cause means a lot to us and we are initiating a small attempt to provide oximeters and concentrators for the underprivileged people and organizations working for them.
Our plan specifics:
·   We are aiming at raise money for 2000 oximeters and 10 oxygen concentrators depending on the fundraising success, therefore we are raising Rs.2100000 towards this project.
· We will follow an 80-20 principle (80% proceeds given to South West district magistrate fund, Delhi & 20% distributed directly by Indian Centre for Development and Rights. The proceeds of South West district magistrate will be given to ASHA and ANM workers and used by these community health workers to offer to the poor and needy on returnable basis. It will be used on rotation.
· Transparency on funds collected, and distribution with execution proof will be maintained and shared so that people donating are assured that the contributions have gone to the ground 
Please lend us your hand with your donations and shares. It would mean the world to beneficiaries.
Thanks.

FEDERATION OF INDIAN PHYSICIANS ASSOCIATIONS APPEAL FOR DONATION

Covid 19’s second wave has created an existential crisis in India since April 2021. India’s first defense of healthcare workers has been engaging with this crisis day and night, yet again.

FIPA is coming forward in these tough times to lend a helping hand to the people of India.

India is facing a shortage of nurses, doctors, and ICU beds. MillionICU by Dozee aims to address current issues and make healthcare infrastructure future-proof - by providing end-to-end services to convert public hospital beds into step-down ICUs.

For less than a cup of coffee a day ($1.5 or Rs. 100), our proprietary contactless vitals sensing technology converts any bed into a step-down ICU. It relays the data over the cloud making it available anywhere and replaces the manual spot checks with continuous monitoring. The data is analyzed by our AI-powered triaging system to alert the clinicians and nurses to take timely actions.

Implemented in over 170 hospitals and 4000+ beds across India, it is proven to reduce nurse's and duty doctor's load by 30% and improving patient outcomes by reducing patient mortality by 5%. 

Just imagine what would have been the impact if every public hospital bed was step-down ICU. 

Under the initiative, we take end-to-end ownership of implementing the devices, training the nurses and doctors, and ensuring smooth functioning in 2000 public hospital beds across 30 hospitals across 8 districts in India. We are raising 3.75 CR towards the same.

We are helping : 
1. Public hospitals(pan-India)
2. Makeshift COVID critical care centers by NGO's
3. COVID isolation centers by NGO's

Vaccines for India
India urgently needs mass vaccinations to fight COVID-19. This will reduce the COVID-19 infection rate, disease severity, dependency on oxygen, and the mortality rate. Further, the virus is mutating; its variants can escape some vaccines. Lastly, some people are hesitant to take the vaccines because of their newness.
We seek to rapidly address these problems. Hope is not a strategy. We need to act.
Our approach: vaccine repurposing.
 Why?
1) The Evidence
Decades of clinical trials firmly show that some existing, vaccines protect against many diseases at once. These include the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis), the measles vaccine, and the oral polio vaccine. Nearly 100 years ago a doctor in Sweden observed that BCG vaccine in newborns brought down “all-cause” mortality nearly three-fold, far beyond what would be expected from TB. Evidence suggests that these vaccines (and the influenza vaccine) may protect against COVID-19. Recent doses may be needed, as the effect may wear off after some years. The likely mechanism, published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine: “trained innate immunity.” The evidence suggests also that they protect within one hour, rather than within two weeks.

2) Safety
These existing vaccines are tried and true, and have been used safely for decades by billions of children. Clinical trials show their safety in adults and children.

3) Access
These existing vaccines are affordable, costing as little as a few rupees a dose. Huge stockpiles exist. They are off patent and their intellectual property is open. That means that all regulatorily-qualified firms have the right to make them. They can reach people faster.

4) Variants Protection
Variants are mutated forms of the virus. Because these vaccines already protect against many viruses at once (by creating a broad immune response from the host) they may be more effective against variants. Mutations will not render them ineffective.

5) Why Us?
Industry has no incentive to pursue this, as there is little money to be made in off patent or low cost
vaccines. But the public health potential is huge. Let us follow the example of the Salk polio vaccine, which was patent free and crowdfunded. Together, as a community, we can create vaccines for all. For coverage of our vaccine work, see the Times of India. - “An Open Source Covid Vaccine Could be Made in India Soon.”

How will your donations be used?
- Final stage vaccine clinical trials: Preparing a multi-center Phase 3 vaccine clinical trial for India, testing measles (MR/MMR), influenza, polio (OPV), and possibly TB (BCG) vaccines against COVID-19 and its variants. If efficacy is found, these existing vaccines, which are safe, low-cost, and mass-produced, can each people rapidly.
o Designing clinical trial protocol.
o Bringing in different partners from government and private organizations
o Working with government and regulatory authorities
o If successful, partially funding the trial itself
- Immunology (lab) studies of these vaccines and whether and how they work against the
SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.
- Supporting work on vaccine repurposing/open source vaccines--- using widely-available off
patent or low cost vaccines to rapidly address pandemics for all people.
- This is a nonprofit effort.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Hello,
When you and I are in our 60's and 70'd and hopefully even further, what do we hope for? More than most of the time we look forward to peaceful living, travelling, spending time with grandchildren, listening to more music and reading more books. There are people who are at that age already but have nothing to live for, no family to take care of them, no real direction and most sadly without much hope.

Abhaya Charitable Trust is a committed and registered old age care home for destitute men and women. It has been in existence since 2004 and has been operating by way of donations and well wishers. The home presently takes care of, houses and feeds 41 people. Since the outbreak of Covid, the regular sources of funds have almost dried up. To make matters worse during this second wave of the pandemic 14 out out of the 41 are currently infected with the virus. Some of them are admitted in the hospital and the rest are being managed at the premises. The team is grappling with the task and at the same time are in dire need of funds.

During these tough times, I request you to join me in raising funds for the functioning of the home. I will also keep you informed from time to time, the progress we are making regarding this cause.

The NGO Abhaya Public Charitable Trust is based out of kochi and are committed to impacting and improving lives for 17 years now. To take our objective a step further, we have begun a crowdfunding campaign to raise 1000000 for the Elderly welfare.
They need your help to continue with their noble work. Will you lend them a hand?

Every tiny donation will be a huge help in saving at least one life. Even sharing this story among your friends and family on social media will be an immense help.

Please donate as this a hard time for many out there and pray that we shall be able to beat Covid-19 soon and together.

An appeal from Chazhikattu Charitable Trust, an organization that supports rural community health needs via Chazhikattu Multi Specialty (CMS) Hospital in Thodupuzha, Kerala. We need your help to support essential healthcare workers and rural community residents in the devastating fight against COVID-19.
HELP US HELP OTHERS:
Chazhikattu Charitable Trust earnestly requests donations from the general public for this humanitarian cause in order to (1) support more patients who are requiring financial assistance for the cost of medical care, nutritional support, and rehabilitation related to COVID and (2) to procure equipment for intensive care such as ventilators, oxygen supplying systems, disposable usables for daily care, and anti-covid medications—all of which are costly but necessary to obtain.
WHO WE SERVE: 
We are located in a predominantly rural, little-industrialized area of Idukki in Kerala and serve a mainly agrarian and economically disadvantaged community. Modern medical treatment costs have risen exponentially beyond the affordability of the residents of the district.
The current COVID surge has caused a sudden influx of over 200 outpatients, 75 inpatients and 18 intensive care patients for COVID-related illnesses on a daily basis. We do not turn any patients away and we strive to provide exceptional care to all of our patients, but this surge has stretched our limits. With your help, we can increase our COVID care capabilities by 50% or more to cope with this influx.
Chazhikattu Multi-specialty (CMS) Hospital was founded in 1933 and is one of the oldest rural hospitals established in India. CMS has expanded to be a multi-super specialty hospital that has NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) pre-accreditation. CMS has 8 major operating rooms, 64 medical and surgical Intensive care beds and clinical laboratory with NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories) recognition. Unlike other medical institutions, we do not demand advance deposit payments for emergency medical or surgical care.
 Our biggest strength is our dedicated staff of 500+ which includes medical, paramedical, administrative and support staff working tirelessly towards providing the best treatment and patient care. Relevant patient care statistics of CMS hospital yearly:
Emergency room visits of 20,000+
Outpatient visits of 200,000+
Inpatient visits of 10,000+
Surgical procedures of 3300+
Labor and deliveries of 1000+
Chazhikattu Charitable Trust with registration number: 83/IV/2009 & IV/98/2014 (amendment) was established in 2009 complying to all the rules and regulations of the government of India. Through donations received, the trust continues to alleviate the financial burden of the needy patients. 
WHY DO WE NEED HELP?
During these unprecedented times, our CMS healthcare workers are at the frontlines. The current Covid-19 pandemic with its second wave has significantly overwhelmed our local health care system:

A significant chunk of Daily Wage workers and their families have been severely impacted due to the ongoing lockdown / containment zones / curfews to tackle the deadly second wave of Covid-19. While construction workers and domestic helpers have job only in places where there is no active Covid case, workers like rickshaw pullers, e-rickshaw drivers, informal waste pickers have no income & are struggling to meet their daily needs for survival.

We request all of you to understand your social responsibility and step forward to help those who help all of us daily.

We, at Green Dream Foundation had taken up a similar initiative during the first wave last year and were able to support more than 1200 families with 3 months' worth of essential groceries and safety gear. CLICK HERE to see a video compilation of some distribution drives from last year.

Since last week of April, more than 200 families have reached out to us seeking similar help with essentials as the lockdown continues to be extended in Uttar Pradesh amid the rising Covid-19 cases. We are committed to continue supporting them with any essential needs and expand the outreach to more families in such ""once in a century"" phase - as soon as possible.

Solution
By utilizing our own resources and gathering support, we want to procure and distribute the following essential groceries to the identified daily wager families: wheat flour, rice, pulses, edible oil, salt, other spices and soaps.

Our volunteers buy the groceries from local stores, ask people from the identified community to come in batches of 10 in an open area and then distribute packets to them with social distancing norms. We have 5 local volunteers available to carry out this work in shifts.

Join Hands together to save the life of Daily wagers by supporting them during lockdown.

About Green Dream Foundation
Green Dream Foundation is working in the domain of socio-environmental sustainability since 2011. Our vision is to raise awareness about the environment, promote knowledge, education & drive action on prime environmental concerns especially waste management, air pollution, water conservation and climate change.

We have been working with various daily-wagers and informal waste-pickers across the country for our environmental initiatives over the past years. Identifying the community & families in need was natural hence; we want to utilize our skills, outreach and capabilities to help them out in these tough times.

Sourcing medical grade oxygen concentrators (Quality assured, safety standards met and product warranty ensured). The patient needs a concentrator for 5-7 days. One high quality oxygen concentrator usually costs ₹70,000 - ₹1,10,000 (approx $800-$1500).

Oxygen concentrators have been found to be an effective instrument in treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms (particularly 85 <SpO2 concentration <94)

People who are exposed to Covid & are tested positive exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms (with no comorbidities) but not serious enough to be admitted to hospitals. They can recover with just an adequate supply of oxygen via the Oxygen concentrators & should not be occupying critical hospital beds which could be leveraged for treating the critical patients.

The objective is to procure high-quality Oxygen concentrators, to ensure that the medical devices can be efficiently rotated across to the ones in need for optimal use and maximum reach (post sanitization). We are enabled by Portea Medical with its presence across 16 cities, to ensure timely delivery, pick up, and installation supports a patient's homes.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser.

I am Bhushan, I was shocked by the demise of my colleague & friend Ramanjaneya Reddy Kunduru (Ram) who was 41 year old. Ram was affected with Covid and was also diagnosed with black fungus and unfortunately, he is no more. He took his last breath on 1st June,2021. He is one of the best and dedicated colleagues I have come through. He was a hard-working guy who used to take the responsibility of entire team. With his sudden demise, we lost an efficient employee. 

He was a great human with kind heart, a caring son, loving husband and good father of two young daughters (2 & 7 years). With a calm and composed behavior, he did his part to the society.

It is an irreplaceable loss and extremely painful for his family and friends to accept the truth that he is no more. Some of friends and colleagues has decided to raise funds through Impact Guru he is the sole breadwinner of the family. Regardless how big or small donation it is, this could go a long way in fulfilling their needs. We request all friends and well-wishers of Ram to come forward and kindly contribute Let us come together and help Ram’s family to get sustained in this tough phase of life.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser.

Monu Lal - A young bright, lively chap, looking forward to a life filled with dreams to pursue, aiming for the moon and having all the qualities to get there. His life journey was abruptly ended on 10th May 2021, when he succumbed to the Covid Devil.

Having just lived for 29 years, but he was a favourite of all; anyone who would meet him was touched by his pleasing personality and his ever smiling face. His family and friends saw his different facets- a marathon runner, a talented tabla-player , an inquisitive chef, an avid traveller, a committed team player, a true friend, a devoted son and brother. He lived a short but beautiful life.

His sudden demise has left a huge void for all who knew him, specially for his family - his mother, his elder brother and his younger sister. While this void can never be filled, here is an effort to help the family get over the financial stress his sudden exit has caused as he was the major bread earner of the family.
We cannot share the emotional stress of the family, but donating generously will definitely help the family in these difficult times.

Each contribution is important! Please help raise the required amount by clicking on the donate button and sharing this fundraiser with family and friends. They will be forever grateful for your help and good wishes.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

India is currently fighting the world's worst second wave of COVID-19. A point made most painfully clear by the loss of Shubham Singhal. Shubham was part of the Foundation Data program at the Pune Technology Centre (PuTC). Shubham’s personal statement “Your imagination is your biggest limitation” sums up his perspective towards life.

A friend to many, a beloved son, and a caring brother, Shubham was a cherished colleague. He was too young to be taken away from his family and friends. He will be always remembered and missed.

Though there is nothing we can do to fill the void that Shubham has left behind, let us show our solidarity with the Singhals by contributing heartily towards Shubham’s memorial fund as a token of all the goodwill and joy Shubham brought to our workplace and our lives.

The devastating effects of COVID-19 became deeply personal when we lost our dear colleague and friend, Krishna Moorthy (39), on May 13 2021. He was a kind, unassuming person who went about his work in a composed manner and never lost his cool in the toughest of situations. 

To Krishna's family, it has been a tragedy like none other. He left behind his wife and two kids aged 4 and 8. As a son, husband, father, friend, and confidante, Krishna will be remembered with great affection by all who knew him in the course of his short life.

As we come to terms with this unexpected loss, we want to make a positive contribution to support Krishna's family. We are raising this fund to give the family a chance to make a future that Krishna would have wanted for them. The beneficiary of this fund is Krishna's wife, Anu.

We urge you to donate generously. Thank you.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Hello everyone, my name is Dhruba Jyoti Talukdar, as we all know this pandemic has hit everyone hard, it is so unfortunate that people are losing their jobs and migrant workers are returning back to their home towns from different parts of the country without having any financial support which makes them even more difficult to survive in such dire situation, people are not able to manage their day-to-day expenses due to which most of the people sleep empty stomach, which also affects directly on their health, however, people like us who manage to meet their ends in such dire situation, we understand how difficult it is to survive without any financial support in today's competitive world and hence we can be someones hope in this difficult times.

Similarly, people living in rural areas have also been affected the most like us, such people do not get any basic support as they are situated in very remote places where it is very difficult to commute in such places, due to which people living there suffer the most, hence we have organized this fundraiser campaign to raise funds so that we can reach out to these people with the all the possible help along with dry ration to defeat the hunger, this is the time that we should come together and help the needy ones and I would like to urge everyone to please support me by your generous donations

This is a cause that means a lot to me and I am really looking forward to achieving this goal.

“Gone from our sight, but forever in our hearts”
Words seem too small to express the unfortunate demise of Shri Mudit Saxena, Indian Economic Service (IES) -2009 Batch. He was tested COVID positive on 27th April 2021. He fought a long battle during the times when the entire nation was grappling with the second wave and breathed his last on 26th May 2021. He was only 40 years old.

He left behind a grieving family of his wife (Ms Namita), 8-year-old daughter (Chhavi) and four ageing parents. This has been the worst phase for the family, as not only he but his entire family tested COVID positive. They tried to recover from COVID through medication and home quarantine initially as it was extremely difficult to find ICU and oxygen beds. However, just in a couple of days, the condition of the family deteriorated to an extent that they required hospitalization. After rigorous efforts from all directions, especially from his workplace, some medical assistance in form of hospitalization was made available for him and his family members. All of them were admitted to different hospitals for COVID recovery. It is extremely painful to share that Namita, w/o Mudit was discharged on an emergency basis from the hospital the day Mudit passed away. Today, the rest of the family members have all been discharged from the hospital and are recovering at home.
 Mudit’s career journey started with the Ministry of Statistics as a Group C officer where he met Namita. Thereafter, he worked as an Economist with Punjab National Bank for some time after which he made the Indian Economic Service which is a group ‘A’ job in the Government of India. Namita, his wife had been with him throughout his journey of career advancement.

Mudit was the strongest pillar of the family. He has been an outstanding, extremely talented young officer and a wonderful human being who has left us too soon. In very short span of his career in Indian Economic Service he held many prestigious positions including Assistant Director in 2013 in Multilateral Division of Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance where his hard work was acknowledged by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan, Chief Economic Adviser to GoI then. He was a very generous and hardworking individual who brought positivity in every situation. He had a rare quality to go out of his way to help others. Mudit played a significant role and contributed tremendously during his stint as Additional Private Secretary to the Hon’ble Minister of state for Railways and Hon’ble Minister of consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in the recent times. He, with his dedication and efforts, has set an example for other officers to follow and achieve. His work has received recognition of present Chief Economic Adviser to Government of India, Dr. Krishnamurthy V. Subramanian too. He had miles to go but then he has left all of us too soon.

Gandhi Hospital is a multispecialty healthcare facility situated in South West Delhi with a mission to cater accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare to middle and low-income groups. However, our mission is continuously challenged during the ongoing pandemic. Nevertheless, we have treated over 2000+ patients over the past year and continue moving ahead with the same enthusiasm. 

The second wave of COVID-19 that began in April 2021 left the healthcare system gasping for oxygen. Hospitals like ours and many others overcame grave hurdles daily to save precious patient lives. Some of the challenges being hospital beds, medication, and PPE shortage, overburdened staff with fear of contracting the virus themselves, inflated cost of healthcare supplies, and the gravest of them all: The Oxygen Shortage.

We have lost our loved ones, a long-standing employee, and have witnessed parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, children, and young adults among many others who succumbed to this deadly disease. However, what is not acceptable to our hospital is: A patient life lost due to the lack of oxygen.

Our struggle to maintain continuous supply of oxygen has included relentless efforts to procure oxygen from plants across North India such as those in New Delhi, Haridwar, Hisar, and Panipat. While we were treating ~100 COVID patients daily, our efforts were also diverted to dealing with the Oxygen Crisis that further burdened an already overworked staff.

Behind the scenes, on an hourly basis our staff including the doctors were managing all the logistics, truck schedules, and coordinating with district and state authorities to avoid running into an oxygen crisis. We succeeded but many a times our hospital was dealing with oxygen reserves lasting only 30 - 45 mins and a few times we found ourselves with no oxygen for an hour. This whole crisis further burdened our financial resources as the operating cost of running trucks and procuring empty oxygen cylinders increased by ~350-400% and ~3000% respectively.

We believe the COVID battle is not over yet hence, we are determined to be better prepared. Therefore, with tremendous pressure on our financial resources, we are making an appeal to you to join us to donate whatever amount you can and amplify our fundraiser wherever you can to help us set up an Oxygen Plant so we can serve more patients and save more lives.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser.

Late Shri. D. Suryanarayana is my uncle ( my mother’s brother). He has diagnosed with Covid-19 with symptoms of fever, cough & severe body pains. We have taken him to the doctor & taken a CT scan chest & found the virus is not severe & started medication as per the doctor's prescription. After 4 days of using medicine suddenly in the evening time, he started feeling oxygen-deficient & was unable to breathe & was in full sweating. Noticing this situation immediately we rushed him to the hospital which is 15 km away from their house on the bike as no transport facility is available due to lockdown. After reaching the hospital seeing the situation doctor has given some injections to increase the oxygen levels noticing the oxygen level came down to 85% of saturation level. He advised us to immediately join the patient in the hospital having a bed with oxygen support. But to our dismay, we couldn’t join him in the hospital as there r no vacant beds available for COVID patients. We tried the whole night but all our efforts were in vain. At last, we could get an oxygen cylinder that was not properly functioning. Having faith in God we brought the patient home with the oxygen cylinder which was not properly functioning as it became very late at night.

After admitting to the hospital first 3 days he was okay as we have interacted over a video call, from day four the patient's condition got deteriorated & on day five the patient was declared dead by the hospital. All our efforts to save him have gone to waste & even god has not shown any mercy on the patient & his family members.

Note:
1. He is survived with his wife,  3 children (one male & 2 female)& an old mother.
2. He is the only earning person in their family & he is a farmer by occupation.

The second wave of COVID 19 unleashed a shockwave of chaos throughout the country. At this point, we all know someone who lost their life to COVID 19 and someone who is fighting the battle. Deaths spiraling out of control, long queues outside the hospital, glowing crematoriums, and overwhelmed medical staff have shown that at such trying times it is only community help that can get us through this. Covi10 is a joint initiative by 4 humanitarian organizations that have understood the needs of society during these testing times and are directly addressing them.

The prevailing pandemic has affected every individual of the society in a direct or indirect way and has caused not just economic but also social destruction. The difficulties that are being faced by society today have created the need to have a dedicated relief task force that can provide curated and relevant help to individuals dealing with COVID. We have been able to segregate the 10 areas of dire need currently in the given categories.

1. Financial & Livelihood insecurity
2. Access to food, medication & essentials
3. Access to hospital, doctors & donors
4. Children & adolescents’ needs
5. Old people’s needs
6. Criminal impacts
7. Social events and associations
8. Healthcare workforce needs
9. Life practices & WFH adoption
10. Emerging mental & behavioral construct

Covi10’s approach in dealing with these needs involves 3 key support areas - Base Kitchen, Volunteers, and Medicollect

We intend to provide 1000 meals daily for the next 60 days to the COVID-affected individuals who need the required nutrition and care for recovery. With the help of households who are eager to join the COVI10 initiative, our task force will be able to help them with linkages and ensure the needed help reaches the individual. Many households have already been identified in the areas of Vashi, Kolhapur, and Gurgaon who’d be happy to join in this cause

Our target is to have 60 people in the Covi10 task force by the end of July ’21 so that we can offer 10 NEEDS-based services and support across 3 working shifts. Our core team is dedicatedly invested to get the right people on board who have the intent and understand the commitment of this endeavor. Considering the bearing this type of work will have on our volunteers, payouts are but a small token of our gratitude.

Finally, we also intend to deliver 1500 medicine boxes/units per city monthly for the next 3 months. By involving emerging NGOs dedicated to the relief work, we will be collecting and procuring remaining medicines from recovered & Covid -ve households and redistributing them in villages and other rural areas across Delhi, Mumbai & Bangalore.

This step has been taken with the motive to be of aid to the individuals and sections of the society that are having a tough time dealing with the crisis without any apparent solution. It is only by lending each other a hand, can we beat this pandemic and get through it. Hence we request you to donate any amount comfortable to this cause so that we can ease the suffering of at least one person. Sharing this cause with your network on social media will be a huge help as well. So please contribute in whatever way you can as we’re all in this together.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

My name is Soujanya Sikdar and I am raising 2500000 towards Education & Training

Soujanya Sikdar, a cute, loving, multi-talented child around 13 years age used to live a happy life in
Gurgaon, India with his parents. He is a student of class VII at Delhi Public School Gugaon and he shows
interest in art &amp; craft, language and science. His happy life has come across a tremendous turbulence
today, where the destiny, powered with the brutal COVID-19 snatched his loving father, Kausik Sikdar,
away from him in the evening of 24 th May 2021.
Soujanya lost his father. His mom who is a homemaker, lost her loving husband and the middle-class
family lost its only earning member, even after spending its last penny to take him back from hospital during the horrible twenty one longs days of treatment under ventilation. Our life will flow on and the time will be passing by. May be this small family will also try its level best to fight back to the main stream of life from this ruin. But there is no answer who will fuel up this little child, Soujanya, for his future, for his dream. We can not fulfill the void in Soujanya’s life but at least we can do is to come together and contribute towards securing his future, as Kausik would have wanted. it is an appeal to the society – Let us come out, let us break the insurmountable barrier of destiny, let us donate something for Soujanya to secure his future. He, with his dreamy eyes, dreams to soar his head to the ultimate highness in his future, powered with all your blessings.

This is a cause that means a lot to me and I am really looking forward to achieving this goal.


Please lend me your hand with your donations and shares. It would mean the world to me.

As the nation is dealing with a deadly pandemic, we are also witnessing the humanitarian nature of our society with everyone lending a helping hand to one another in any way possible. The shortage of oxygen/ventilator/hospital beds has put a huge number of lives at risk especially for the underserved individuals of our society who are unable to afford it at exorbitant rates.

Ever since the second wave’s shock wave hit the country, our lives have been turned upside down. Everyone has been affected in some or another way. However, the worst brunt has been faced by the ones who belong to a low socioeconomic background. Without the necessary finances available to afford healthcare, many of them are sitting outside hospitals trying to save their families. 

During this pandemic, we have taken up a great responsibility to safeguard society by providing for their needs. Thus, assuring the funds raised to be highly used only for Food Distribution.

They need your help to continue with their noble work. Will you lend them a hand?
Every tiny donation will be a huge help in saving at least one life. Even sharing this story among your friends and family on social media will be an immense help.
Please donate as this a hard time for many out there and pray that we shall be able to beat Covid-19 soon and together.

My uncle and aunt tested positive for Corona and admitted to a Government hospital name Guru Nanak Hospital Amritsar on 01-May-2021. Both of them faced issues while breathing and resulting in a huge drop in oxygen level. After diagnosis doctor mentioned infection in the lungs and started their treatment. But with all the effort we put on, we couldn't able to save my aunt from this deadly disease and she passed away after a week. Before we could recover from this huge sudden setback, the doctor recommended transferring my uncle to some other hospital where proper oxygen (ICU) facility would be available and then my uncle admitted to EMC SUPER SPECIALITY Hospital Amritsar on 08-May-2021. The per-day cost of treatment was 40000 to 50000 including hospital expenses, medicines, and daily tests. On 24th May, after approximately 24 days in total of continuous fighting for his survival, he passed away due to a sudden drop in oxygen level.

In these 24 days, the family had put all their savings. They have two children and will be needing help to raise a fund of Rs.250000 for the family.

I request you to please donate however much you can to help the family. Each contribution is important.

The deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in India. More alarmingly, it has spread to rural areas, home to disadvantaged people who cannot afford even basic medicines, lack awareness to protect themselves from the disease and have little or no access to existing healthcare infrastructure if they fall sick. In these desperate times, a group of entrepreneurs and professionals with expertise in medical, clinical, operational, grassroots connect, and various other areas have come together to form ‘LokSakha’ (Friends of the People) and devise a model project to fight the spread of the pandemic in villages. It will do so by providing comprehensive care, treatment and support to those affected. LokSakha’s project will be a model that can be replicated across the country.
But, LokSakha cannot do it alone. It needs your support to help the people in need. Your contributions will save lives.

The following are some of the important details:

LokSakha’s humanitarian project incorporates:
Awareness
• Testing
• Vaccination
• Medicines & allied support
• Daily care
• Treatment

The project will start with a pilot run at two locations in rural Bengal:
1. Villages around Raiganj town in North Dinajpur district; target population size: 4000-5000; local partners: Raiganj Muktir Kandari (an NGO)
2. Kurumboghosh and surrounding villages near Bolpur town in Birbhum; target population size: 2000-3000; local partners: Naibedya (a volunteer group)

LokSakha’s project will be integrated with the government effort and implemented by a network of volunteers to ensure the existing healthcare infrastructure is not overwhelmed and lives are saved. Post the pilot completion, the project will be scaled up and replicated across multiple locations in rural West Bengal.
Every donation will be a huge help in saving lives. Even sharing this story among your friends and family on social media will be an immense help.

Please donate. We can defeat COVID-19, together.
 A team of 50-100 are working hard to help us meet our objective of transforming lives. But we can’t do that without you. Join us in helping millions with your generosity.

Shambhu, a field technician lost his primary source of income because of lockdown. 
He did not even have money to buy basic medicines for his family. He is constantly looking for opportunities where he can leverage their skills and earn rather than a one-time donation. When he heard about Oxygen Concentrators, he knew that he cannot buy an oxygen concentrator but he can definitely fix one. 



In a matter of few days, our country will have lacs of OCs but no technical infrastructure to maintain these 
machines since 90% of them are non-branded and without any manufacturer’s support. This complex machinery, which is vital for survival for affected patients, will soon become a liability if not taken care of properly. How? Well, our research shows that 7% of machines are box-dead which means 7 out of every 100 machines don’t even turn on when taken out of the box. Another good percentage of machines break down or require maintenance services in the next few weeks to months of usage. If these complicated machines are not maintained properly, they would lead to unplanned downtime which ultimately will be very critical for patients.

Oxi care realizes this and now is on a mission to provide jobs to 1000+ jobless technicians like Shambhu who lost their jobs during the pandemic. A Service Technician is the most hard-working person in the field. He is the one who brings our expensive gadgets back to life and yet he is the one who is most unnoticed and most underpaid. We are providing every technician with free Training to repair Oxygen Concentrators and also assigning him calls to actually repair defective concentrators. We are then paying them for every call so that by the end of the day they have enough money to support their families.

These trained oxicare warriors will make these concentrators work, thereby saving millions of lives and also millions of dollars for India. We are making them ready for the current and future crisis so that they can save lives by offering these critical maintenance services and become part of India's healthcare infrastructure.

To support the mission, Oxicare needs funds to provide FREE TRAINING, buy spares, buy equipment for servicing and also pay thousands of jobless service engineers who will act as a backbone in providing critical maintenance services to India. Help us and support this mission to save lives.

My name is N BENJAMIN MATHEWS and I am raising 100000 towards COVID Relief for Kalpana Project.

The COVID crisis is affecting the Indian population severely. With basic infrastructure being overwhelmed, help arranging for supplies has become imperative. Kalpana Project is raising funds to help families with resources including but not - groceries, oxygen, medical bills and procedures. We distributed groceries, masks, and other basic essentials in over 50 bastis during the first wave and have started doing grocery distributions again after the lockdown.

We all started a helpline along with a team of doctors that helps people with doctor consultation and with finding oxygen, hospital beds, and ambulance. Funds contributed will also be used to help people financially, if needed. 

This is a cause that means a lot to us and we are really looking forward to achieving this goal.
If you have the means - please consider donating any amount you are able to. We are trying to raise funds as quickly as possible. No amount is too small!

Thank you.

# RightToLive. 
COVID Relief Funds For Hospital Amenities Initiated
By The Power Of Youth

With the pandemic raging on, the number of cases and deaths are spiraling out of control. Everyone reading this must have heard of at least one person in their network who lost their lives due to COVID. While many are pleading with others to help in some way, many others have given up hopes while waiting for oxygen or medicines. As the end of this disaster is nowhere on the horizon, community help is the only thing standing between life and death. The Power of Youth is a group of individuals who are trying to ensure that maximum people receive the needed help and don’t reach a juncture where they have to give up hope.

They have helped patients with 300+ ICU beds as well as 500+ ventilator beds. They have been providing oxygen cylinders to those who are in dire need of it as well as 500 packets of nutritious and fresh meals to the BKC jumbo COVID care center, ESIC hospital in Kandivali, the police stations, police check-posts, Shatabdi hospital, roadside BMC workers and needy people. Besides, they have also helped in the vaccination of the elderly, provided financial assistance to families in need as well oxygen. 

To date, they are receiving calls from people who need either oxygen or food during these trying times. They have been helping countless people however since funds are a limited resource, the continuation of this noble initiative depends on the generosity of kind people like you. We can’t help millions, but will you help one?

The Power of Youth has pledged to provide 100 semi ICU beds to Kolkata, 50 semi ICU beds to Dehradun, 100 Semi ICU beds to Delhi, and 100 semi ICU beds to Maharashtra and MP villages.

They also wish to take up these activities in the future so that we can get through this situation 
Provide PPE kits to doctors
Prepare an isolation center for kids to deal with the 3rd wave
Provide more oxygen support to hospitals
Create more campaigns to spread awareness amongst kids to take care of themselves

This will only be possible if you help out by donating whatever you can towards this cause. Even one share from you on social media could change someone’s life for good. Please help out in whatever way you can so that we can all get through this catastrophe together!","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Doon Volunteers is a group of individuals from Dehradun who have come together to help the people in need. We are trying to help as many villages in the remote areas of Uttrakhand as we can. 

We all know the situation of Uttarakhand right now. The villages don't have any access to any type of medical supplies, and even if they are tested positive they are getting treated on their own. We want to help as we can with the medical kits in the villages. Our goal amount is to raise 5 lakh rupees to help 1000 villages. This money will be used to create COVID care centers and to provide medical supplies to the villages. We are also trying to create awareness of the COVID in these villages as the villagers are still denying the fact that covid exists. We are also training the villagers so that they can become nursing staff.

We are setting up through verified channels on the ground who report the real situation to us and help us distribute the aid to the people in need directly.

Every tiny donation will be a huge help in saving at least one life.

Even sharing this story among your friends and family on social media will be an immense help. Please donate as this is a hard time for many out there and pray that we shall be able to beat COVID 19 soon and together.

My name is Sivakumar Srinivasan, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

My sister, Ms Malathy, runs a school (Vidhya Bharathi Primary School, Coimbatore, through a charitable trust - Vidhya Bharathi Charitable Trust).  Kids of this school are unable to return to the school since their parents cannot afford a smartphone and pay the basic nominal fee for school sustenance. A halt in their education will lead to a lot of parity in the future leading to another pandemic called poverty & unemployment.   In a school with 200 children, only 40 could continue the last academic year.  With mostly lower middle class to the poor economic background with an impermanent job, they struggle to meet their ends.
At the bare minimum, the cost works out to be Rs. 30k per child for the coming academic year.
Smartphone / tablet costs about Rs. 12k
Teacher Salary per child (annual) Rs. 12k
Internet cost for the whole year Rs. 3k
Notebooks, books & misc Rs. 3k
Open your wallet for the future of these children.
It's our responsibility.
How much ever, you can help, please do.
We will keep you informed of the progress of the child through the academic year

With the second Covid wave on, the school is not seeing the return of these kids – substantial in number.  About half of the remaining 160 can return to school if there is a means of getting technological assistance for online classes and a significant cut in school fee. 
The academic year is starting in a month or so.  Your timely help will go a long way.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Aa Chalke Tujhye, Main Leke Chalun,
Ek Aise Gagan Ke Tale,

As I hum the tune of this beautiful song by Kishor Da, my heart longs to walk my country and its people to a pandemic-free world, where the cries and pain of so many around us will disappear, and all that will surround us is happiness and good health.

That’s when I heard a voice from within that said, “Nisha, you need to do something.”

It all began with a deep sense of gratitude and a pinch of pricking guilt when I saw and read about innumerable people in need, who’re not half as lucky and fortunate as I am. I am blessed to have a little more than what they do. Doesn’t that call for some responsibility to take care of them to whatever extent I can? It does. And here I am, on my 25th birthday, inviting EACH ONE OF YOU to join hands with me to help underprivileged people from Bangalore survive and sustain the pandemic crisis.


Sending HELP, Spreading HOPE, Sharing HAPPINESS
With Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust - Home for Old Age, Orphans & Destitute

I came across this amazing team from Bangalore that’s running Sree Sai Krupa Charitable Trust, a non-profit, non-political and secular organisation. Founded in 2007 by Mr. Shivarudra, and ably supported by his wife Shashi, the organisation today houses 95 people from different age groups and backgrounds, who have nowhere else to go to. This includes orphans, children with single parents & children who are socially misled, old citizens, and even the destitute women.

I was touched and moved by the kind of work that the couple has been doing selflessly in all these years.

""Helping one person might not change the whole world, but it could change the world for one person""

Not everyone has a fair chance at life. I know a lady named Radha who has been going through a lot of hardships in her life. While she was supposed to live a happy married life after her marriage, but fate took away her husband to an accident. When she decided that she will continue her life now with her little daughter, life had totally something else in the store for her, her daughter Divya was diagnosed with CANCER. She struggled for 15 straight years to save her only daughter, she sold her factory, all her assets, borrowed money for people for her treatment, unfortunately, cancer claimed her daughter’s life too last month.

Today, she is all alone by herself in Bangalore City and trying not to give up on life. She approached me today after a month since she informed me about her daughter’s demise. She is struggling to afford a square meal for herself. Yet instead of asking me to help her with some money to survive, she is asked me to help her find a job in Bangalore.

I am no big writer, I am just trying to put forth a message asking for help.

She expressed to me that she at times feels like giving up on life but yet she has been holding herself strong. She is a real fighter, who has been fighting to save her loved ones, but today she is just left alone.

I want to help her in whatever way I can, help her survive through this lockdown, set up her own small business so that she can live a peaceful life and have a fair chance at life. 

I have donated my bit towards the fundraiser, please support me by making a small contribution to your own capability. Any help is deeply appreciated & will be grateful.  ","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

We will miss a dedicated colleague, a friend eager to help everyone. Santosh was associated with the company for a period of more than 9 Years. He had built a place for himself in the company. Our sincere condolences to his family for the loss.
Santosh’s sudden demise not only left his family in shock emotionally but also financially. Financial support at this point to his family would help them a lot. The funds will help his daughter achieve her dreams by getting good education.
We are raising funds for sending to his family. Please help generously for the noble cause. The funds received will be directly sent to Santosh’s wife’s bank account.
This is a cause that means a lot to me and I am really looking forward to achieving this goal.

Jitendra's Family",https://d2aq6dqxahe4ka.cloudfront.net/assets/uploads/campaigns_gallery/help-jitendra-family161976766972282.jpeg,"Story
Jitendra Durgapal was a husband, father, son, software engineer and techie, teammate, life-of-the-party, friend to everyone he met…and so much more to those who really knew him. He was also a fighter who refused to slowdown or give up no matter what the odds or challenges he faced…professionally or privately.

Most of us around the globe have never given much thought to the word “pandemic” before 2020…and even less so of the illness we now know all too well as “Covid19”. Covid19 is no respecter of persons, national boarders, race or ethnicity, or any other factors that we as human beings are subject to. Jitendra contracted Covid19 and fought for his life for over two weeks; but ultimately this horrific disease was just too much for his body to overcome and so at 5am IST on the 24th of April 2021…he took his last breath and passed on from this world with his loved ones by his side.

…but this is not the end of his story ladies and gentlemen…oh no…not for one minute!!!

For those who knew Jitendra, a part of him will forever stay in our hearts, our souls and our memories. We will remember him as having a loving sense of humor, able to illuminate those around him with his bright smile and outgoing personality. We will remember him as larger than life. We will remember him as a consummate professional who enjoyed creating cutting edge software in the health care industry for Optum Technology, where he truly made an impact to tens of thousands of people around the world to live better, happier and healthier lives through cutting edge software applications.

He led by example in all he did…whether it was in a war room helping to restore stability to production environments of some of the worlds largest companies and clients, or just at home helping his wife and son with the day-to-day family duties and chores; he was truly an inspiration and loved by all those who knew him.

Jitendra was also an avid swimmer and “foodie”! He especially looked forward to Wednesday’s because of the free Domino’s pizza he shared with his coworkers. He loved and lived life to its fullest in all he did…both personally and professionally.

Jitendra Durgapal…we love you; we’ll miss you, but we will never forget you. May you rest in peace with love and dignity forevermore. In his loving memory we are raising $100,000 for the well-being and fruitful future of his Family.

If Jitendra’s life or story has warmed your heart in some way, or you have fond memories or words of encouragement you’d like to share with his family or friends…then please do share your thoughts and comments here.

With the 2nd wave of COVID-19, India witnessed an outrageous Oxygen shortage everywhere. People affected by the virus desperately needed Oxygen, which continued to be scarcely available and the situation continues. Countless people lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen and many were forced to beg, borrow or steal oxygen to save their loved ones. Even hospitals were finding themselves helpless as the oxygen supply discontinued many a times. It was really heart breaking to see so many people die because they were not able to get oxygen on time or they couldn't get it at all. Rural areas are worst affected as the heath infrastructure is minimal there.
The health pandemic authorities have warned us about a 3rd wave. We must be prepared before we get the slightest hints of the beginning of the 3rd wave. My endeavor is to manufacture oxygen concentrators in India with locally available components to keep it cost effective and readily available. This will be my little contribution to the country if I can save some lives.
I need your immediate strong financial support through this fund raiser drive so that I can get on with the production earliest. I can't do this without your help. Being a part of society, it is our duty to help and save lives of as many as we can. Please donate whatever amount you can. Every donation counts.

HELP THE POOR STUDENTS WITH BOOKS THEY NEED TO STUDY
Hello, My name is Vikram Singh and I am raising Rs. 264,400 towards Startup Fundraising
.
I am a writer and journalist. I live in a small town Machhiwara Sahib in Ludhiana district of Punjab (India). I hope most of you already know that I am raising funds to donate library books to local Government schools and Government recognized schools for poor and needy students in district Ludhiana.

I am trying to provide the said schools with 200 sets of books (worth Rs. 992 each) with my crowd funding project. These schools lack useful library books on account of limited resources. Though resources are meagre, yet the number of needy is higher. This is the problem I need to solve with the funds I am trying to collect.

 I am planning to do the activities as soon as I collect the sufficient required funds. I need to raise the money by 15th of June, 2021. And distribute the books in question within next 30 days.

I am going to implement my project from my home town Machhiwara Sahib in Ludhiana district of Punjab (India). Initially my project is confined to district Ludhiana. However, in course of time, I wish to cover the entire state of Punjab.

I don’t have another financial way to carry out this idea. I believe my idea will benefit a lot of students. I also believe that many people will be interested in my idea and they will love to participate in it. I really want all the people to contribute to my project and support the same cause I support. 

I am planning to use the collected funds in the following manner:-
Rs. 198400 for 200 sets of Books @ Rs. 992 per set
Rs. 30000 for Distribution Charges @ Rs. 150 per set
Rs. 20000 for Storage Rent for 4 months @ Rs. 5000 per month
Miscellaneous Expenses Rs. 16000

In this way, I need to raise Rs. 264,400 to achieve my objective. You can help students get education by donating money to get books. I hope you will join me in this mission.  Please lend me your hand with your donations and shares. It would motivate me to reach my goal, no matter what. I am grateful to you for every Rupee you decide to donate in order to enable me to distribute books. I am thankful to you for this act of kindness and also for taking the time to visit my fund raising page.

Thank you for your support,

With gratitude,
Vikram Singh","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Hi Dear Friends and Well Wishers,
I am Molly Pande, wife of Mr. Shivendra Pande (Age - 34 years). My husband is currently on artificial lung support (ECMO) in Apollo Hospital Chennai. His hospital expenses at Apollo as on 4th June 2021 (2 p.m) is INR 50.44 lacs. Shivendra was found COVID positive in April 2021 and was hospitalised on 19th April at Lucknow as he was struggling to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. He has been on ECMO support for the past 27 days. 

It all started on 14th April 2021 when he tested Covid positive along with all of his family members i.e. his ailing father (78 years), myself (his wife), Devansh (4 years old son) and Dhanvika (one year old daughter). On the morning of 19th April 2021, he had a very high fever and fainted due to low oxygen level. We rushed him to a private hospital for immediate support and thereafter shifted him to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow. He showed no signs of improvement and eventually, he was shifted to Ventilator support on 30th April 2021. The doctors informed that his lung condition has worsened and he requires ECMO support to save his life. Thereafter, we got in touch with the Lung & Heart department at Apollo Hospital Chennai, and then we decided to proceed with further treatment.
 The team of doctors came to Lucknow to initiate ECMO in Lucknow, after having seen and understood Shivendra's clinical condition. Shivendra was then airlifted from Lucknow via Air Ambulance on 11th May 2021. He was admitted in Apollo Hospital, Greams Road, Chennai and has been on ECMO support since then. The recovery process is slow and as on date, his lungs are unable to function independently i.e. lungs are unable to oxygenate the blood and release CO2 and so would continuously require ECMO life support for another 3-4 weeks at Apollo Chennai.
 The cost of initiation of ECMO and transfer cost from Lucknow to Chennai through air ambulance with ECMO was INR 32.65 Lacs, and the daily hospitalization cost of ICU and ECMO is INR 2 Lacs (approx) per day, which has significantly pushed up the medical expenses. We have already incurred more than INR 90 lacs on his treatment till date and the treatment cost is increasing significantly on a daily basis. We have already arranged for INR 50 lacs (approx.) through insurance, savings and support from family & friends. However, since the expenses are significantly huge, I request you to kindly contribute towards the treatment and help during this time of need. Each contribution is important towards saving Shivendra's life!!

Shivendra is fighting with each breath and so is our entire family. Our children and his aged father are waiting for him to be back home. Shivendra needs your financial support along with your good wishes and blessings. Please help us in raising funds by clicking on the donate button and sharing this page with your friends and family. I will be grateful for your help and wishes.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Dear Supporters,

We are reaching out for your help and request with folded hands for immediate attention. Settem Sujatha Prasad, 51 years old is a known hypertensive, non-smoker, and non-alcoholic. 
She has a husband, and two children 24 years and 26 years old. 

A humble appeal from Sujatha's Daughter, 24 years old Priyanka Settem, to all of you to save her mother Sujatha.

She was initially infected with coronavirus and Hospitalized in Tanvir Hospital, a small hospital near her place, on 13th April after her post-vaccination symptoms did not improve. Upon admission, she tested negative for the virus on a swab test but HRCT confirmed the Covid-19 diagnosis. Slowly her condition started to deteriorate with her Oxygen Saturations dipping to as low as 60s. Soon she was moved to the ICU and was being managed with heavy Oxygen support, and Steroids along with the usual COVID Care. 

When her Sats failed to improve and the infection in the lungs kept progressing she was moved to Apollo hospitals, Jubilee hills, Hyderabad, for better facility and Care. 

During her stay in the ICU at Apollo, her family had to bear expenses of Remdesivir, which at that time was only available in the black market and procurement was very difficult, Oxygen cylinders and other medications. 

After staying for over a month at the ICU in Apollo, she was moved to the regular Non COVID ICU for continued monitoring, during which she was found to be infected with the Black Fungus or Mucormycosis. 
The doctors had to immediately perform endoscopic sinus surgery to clear the infection followed by Amphotericin B treatment.
The hunt for the medicine was exhausting with the medicine being out of stock for days. 
After spending lakhs in just procurement of the said medicine, her family was able to see her through the antifungal treatment. 

Through this entire process, the family has been using up all their life savings to pay for the medicines, facilities, and hospital bills. 
As of today, the family has had to pay nearly 30lakhs for all of the expenses. 

On 26th May 2021, Sujatha was discharged from the hospital and sent home after she was doing better at the hospital. 

At home, she was still on oxygen support with the help of the oxygen concentrator. 
On the 31st morning, she started profusely bleeding from her nose and mouth. The ambulance was summoned to take her to the hospital. In the ambulance, she started vomiting blood. She was rushed back to Apollo hospitals. The doctors suspect the Black fungus to have eroded the arteries causing heavy bleeding. 

Embolization of the arteries was performed immediately after which her bleeding was brought under control. As of today, my mother is now back in the ICU, this time hooked to the Ventilator. 

The hospital and treatment bills are skyrocketing and the family is unable to manage the finances. 

The treatment so far has cost about 30 lakhs in rupees. The recent embolization surgery along with necessary medications has additionally costed 2-2.5lakhs. She is now currently in the hospital ICU, and the bill will continue to increase. The family has now exhausted all their financial resources and seeks any kind of monetary support that they can get. 

Even the smallest contribution will make a big difference. Kindly please help.

Hi Everyone

My name is Krishna Murthy Bonala, I just recovered from COVID after being in hospital for 20 days, now my wife Bonala Sujatha who is currently being treated for Covid 19, was with BiPAP support for 10-15days then, she has been shifted to ICU with a ventilator support since 20 days and admitted to Apollo jubilee Hills Hospital, Hyderabad. Her CT Severity report is 25/25 and she is responding to the treatment.

Now, the COVID report is negative but the lungs have been affected. My son-in-law, my daughter, and I have spent all our hard-earned money on my wife's ongoing treatment as I am financially stuck. I am currently finding it difficult in arranging finance as I have two kids, both are not working. But, all our savings and additional loan amounts we kept in paying hospital bills till now.

The treatment is costing us 30 Lakhs. I am seeking financial help from whoever can contribute how much ever is possible. It would be of great help. Please with my folded hands, I want my wife back home as she is my only strength and support system. I don't want to lose her.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

Hi, my name is Nikunj and I am raising funds for my younger brother Ujjwal who is suffering from blood cancer.

My brother has been fighting for his life since he was 21 years old. He doesn't have any medical insurance so we have to do all the treatment in cash only. He diagnosed with Blood Cancer first time in 2017 treated in Artemis Hospital by Dr. Raman Kain.

But due to Bad luck, I say the disease was Relapsed again in May 2019 followed by Chemotherapy Sessions, and then we have to immediately undergo a bone marrow transplant at the Asian Institute of medical science by Dr. Prashant Mehta, and & total cost of treatment was around 18 lakhs.

Bt after completing the transplant, unfortunately, the disease relapsed again a second time in form of tumor masses in the chest, abdomen, and spines.

“Currently he has undergone chemo injections and a tablet called Venetoclax which is very costly (Approx 1 lakh for 1 month) as it’s Imported Medicine but its require urgently to control the disease for a time being to be able to start the further suggested treatment although it is very difficult to purchase this medicine as all our funds already debited”

Now doctor told me that my brother requires urgent treatment with inj. Nelarabine followed by a second Allogenic bone marrow transplant and the cost for the above treatment will be 50 lac INR approx.

""My brother still fighting however, cancer seems to take more and more control of his body "".
Having faced that situation twice, I pray to God none of the parents ever have the ill fortune to witness their own child suffering from cancer from time and again ..

My family's happiness lies in ujjwal. Him being the youngest member of my family of four, all of us are accustomed to his joyous and playful .when he becomes extremely sick the first time he was scared and sad. Yet he tried to cheer all of us as much as he could.

The treatment is costing us 50lakh and we need funds to continue the treatment. we are unable to pay the required amount because we cannot afford such a huge amount. I request you to kindly contribute towards the treatment and help in this hour of need.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

My name is Pulkit Jain and I am raising funds for my father Anil kumar jain who is suffering from  Diffuse Mediastinal Emphysema, Post Covid Pneumonia and Severe Heart Condition.

The treatment is costing us 1000000 and we need funds to continue the treatment. We are unable to pay the required amount because we cannot afford such a huge amount. I request you to kindly contribute towards the treatment and help in this hour of need.

Each contribution is important! Please help raise the required amount by clicking on the donate button and sharing this fundraiser with family and friends. We are grateful for your help and good wishes.


My father treatment is going on for Covid 19 and it's post effect since 26 April 2021.

Today, he is in critical condition with 80% infection in left lung and 40% right lung. His heart is also working with only 35% capacity and BP continuously being very low. 

At Yatharth Hospital, doctors treatment and sisters care help him to cope up mentally and physically.

He showed some signs of improvement initially but now his condition is critical and doctors and hospital staff is doing their best to save him. 

Initially, at home, I tried to give best possible treatment from private nurse, oxygen concentrator to costliest medicines and injections. 

His covid situation improved but his lungs condition deteriorated. 

We admitted him in Max Hospital, Patparganj on 24 May but next 10 days turnout to be a nightmare for my father's health and left huge financial hole in pocket. 

When we saw him after 10Days, he was just a skeleton without flesh. By God's grace we shifted him to Yatharth Hospital, Noida Extension on 4 June 2021.

During this period his lungs got severely affected with 20/25 latest CT score and increased diffuse mediastinal emphysema. 

Last two months were very challenging mentally, physically and financially for me and my family specially for my mother. 

This might be his last chance to get some more time to play with his grand daughter and create wonderful memories for her. 

Please help me to give my father one last chance to have few more wonderful moments of life and nurturing my daughter with his love, wisdom and compassion.","Transfer directly to the Bank account of the Fundraiser. Only INR transfers are allowed.

My name is Meera Ahuja and I am raising funds for my husband, Rocchak Ahuja who is suffering from Covid 19 and Pneumonia. He is on ventilator support for the past 44 days. He has been diagnosed with “Cavitatory Lung Abscess “. To address this, he must undergo a major surgery as soon as possible. He is currently in the ICU undergoing treatment at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai.

So far, we have managed to pay Rs 22 lakhs till date from our end. Furthermore, Rs 35-40 lakhs are the amount required for continuing the treatment and we are in a shortage of funds to continue the treatment. We have exhausted all our savings and insurances for his treatment so far. He is the sole bread winner in our family, and we have an 8-year-old son. We are unable to pay the required amount because we cannot afford or arrange such a huge amount required for the surgery on such short notice.

I request you to kindly contribute towards the treatment and help us in this hour of need. Each contribution is important! Please help raise the required amount by donating to this fundraiser and sharing this campaign with your family and friends. Kindly remember him in your prayers too!
